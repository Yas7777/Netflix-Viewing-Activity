# Viewing Activity (Netflix) Visualization Project

This idea was born out of my need to figure out how much Netflix I have consumed and what shows I have spent  an obscene amount of time on.   
* **Version 1:** Only worked with my own data.
* **Version 2:** Works with any user's data. (Future improvements - 1)

## Installation and Tools

* Install an IDE of your choice  
    > I prefer PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/
* Install  Python 3  
    > https://www.python.org/downloads/
* CSV file containing Netflix Viewing Activity
    > Detailed instructions to download: https://help.netflix.com/en/node/101917

## Programming Languages and libraries used
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries used:** Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn  

## Using the Program

The program requires user input three times, listed below:

1 - CSV File: Copy the exact file path of the CSV file that you downloaded and paste the path when asked:
  > __For example:__ 
  > /Users/library/Data/Downloads/netflix-report/ViewingActivity.csv

This csv file will be cleaned up to remove unnecessary data and arrange existing data as required for visualizations.

2 - Profile Name: Given that Netflix account usually contains multiple profiles/users - this allows us to see visualisations
associated with just ONE profile/user. Enter one of the profile names so that Graph 2, 3, 4 can be plotted. 

> __For example:__ 
  > Yasmeen

3 - Heatmap: Enter the name of a TV Show that you have watched, which you would like to see a heatmap plotted for:
> __For example:__ 
  > Friends
## Graphs

**1 - Grouped Bar Graph by Profile**  
  >* **Details :** Illustrates how much each Netflix profile in your account has watched (in terms of duration hours) 
  >* **Image** (_my data for illustration purposes only)_
  > [Graph 1](Figure_1.png)  
>* **Parameters:**
 >  * X-Axis: Years
 >  * Y-Axis: Duration in hours  
 
**2 â€“ Stacked Bar Graph:**  
  
>* **Details:** TV Shows watched vs Movies in terms of Duration (hours) each year.  
>* **Image** (_my data for illustration purposes only)_  
[Graph 2](Figure_2.png)  
>* **Parameters:**  
>  * X-Axis: Years  
>  * Y-Axis: Duration in hours  
  
**3 - Horizontal Bar Graph**  
  
>* **Details:** Top 10 TV shows watched in terms of Duration (hours)  
>* **Image** (_my data for illustration purposes only)_  
[Graph 3](Figure_3.png)  
>* **Parameters:**  
  >  * X-Axis: Duration in minutes  
  >  * Y-Axis: TV shows  
  
**4 - Heatmap**   
  
>* **Details**: Heatmap of your viewing activity on a show of your choice  
>* **Image** (_my data for illustration purposes only)_  
[Graph 4](Figure_4.png)  
>* **Parameters:**  
  >  * X-Axis: Years   
  >  * Y-Axis: Months  
  
## ðŸ”¥My Hot TakesðŸ”¥

* The CSV file from Netflix requires significant clean-up to make it usable.   
* I did not use seaborn for stacked bar graphs as I found it particularly hard to use.   
* With every graph created, many sanity checks are needed to ensure that the data is correct. Some are included in this code, however, I have significantly condensed it here for readability and to ensure the focus is on the graphs.  

## Future Improvements

* ~~Streamline data clean-up such that the code can be used for any user's data without amending the original code to account for that user's specific Netflix viewing activity.~~
* Include the IMDb library to see how ratings correlate with viewing activity.  
* Include viewing activity data from other streaming platforms' data (HBO, Hulu, etc.)
